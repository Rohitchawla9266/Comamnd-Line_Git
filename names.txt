Here i have added the data while using vi.txt 

and we have used the commands such as git comm

and for using the commands such as git commit -m "here we have added the text " 

and m means the message 
for checking the status we use git status 
and cat cmd is used to display the contnets of the file in cmd 
and green colour means that we have added the changes 
and red colour means that we have deleted the data 
and if we want to remove the data without commiting we can use command 
git restore --staged names.txt
and we can also check the history by using 
git log 

and if we wnat to deete any commit we and we copy one hash id and all the commits will get deleted above of that copied hash id 
and we will use the command called git reset 0e538411960091e37ecda38c08d8419e3ed90c72
